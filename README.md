# Moodle Documentation

## FIND APPLICATION CREDENTIALS

### Option 1: Find Credentials By Checking The System Log On The AWS Cloud Console (EC2)
    After creating EC2 Moodle instance acquire username and password of Moodle in "Action > Instance Setting > Get System Log".

(NOTE: We can see this log only once when we stop an instance we won't see it again.)

### Option 2: Find Credentials By Connecting To Your Application Through SSH
    
    Connect to the application through SSH.
    Run the following command to see your application credentials:
`   sudo cat /home/bitnami/bitnami_credentials
`

   You can find more information from 'https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/faq/get-started/find-credentials/'.

## CHANGING CREDENTIALS

- Once logged in by default username and password you can update the password for ease of understanding by following the steps below :

- Click on `"Admin User"` on top right corner `Profile`

- Actions Menu appears alongside select `Change password`

- Follow the steps after and `Save changes` once done.

## CUSTOMIZATION OF APPLICATION

- After Login as superuser, we get "customizing this page" option on the top right corner using this we can customize our home page.

- The Site administrator can change theme settings and customize in "Site administration > Appearance > Themes"
    If we want to add a new theme then we can download the theme plugin from here 'https://moodle.org/plugins/'.

- We can install, update, and delete plugins in "Site administration > Plugins" in this section.

## UPLOAD USERS

- For adding multiple users we need to create text or CSV file and we have to mention the appropriate field in the file.

- After uploading users we can create cohorts and assign a role then we can enroll multiple users in the courses and add some restrictions on them.

- We can check the permission of the particular user in "Site administration > Users > Permissions > Check system permissions".

## CATEGORIES AND COURSES

## LANGUAGE SETTING

## ATTACH ELASTIC IP TO AN INSTANCE

- On your EC2 AWS Console goto:
`Network & Security > Elastic IPs > Allocate Elastic IP address > Allocate`

- Once getting the Elastic IP Select the Instance you want to attach IP to  and follow `
	" Actions > Networking > Associate Elastic IP Address
`

## TRANSITIONING TO HTTPS

- Converting an instance to https support you need to map instances IP to the domain

- As the instance changs IP from each time you need to assign Elastic IP to your instance.

- After mapping the IP to domain follow the steps on the terminal which is connected through SSH to your instance.

- Follow the steps: 
	- `sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool`
	- In the resulting screen add the domain name to which the IP is being mapped and follow the steps thereafter.
	- Add the email which will be site administrators mail address which registers the site to the domain and notifies through the mail.

- And you have access to the site through the domain name.
